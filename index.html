    <h1>Michael T Bolla Elevator Project</h1>
        <h2>To Get a C, you need to:</h2>
        <p><strong>Find an Elevator:</strong> TTU MCOM Building</p>
        
        <p><strong>Take photos of the Control Interface:</strong></p>
        <h3>TTU MCOM Control Interface</h3>
        <center><img src="MCOMElevator.jpg" alt="MCOMElevator"
            width ="400" 
            length ="341"  /> </center>
        
        <p><strong>Show gif image of the control interface in operation:</strong> </p>
        <h3>Gif Image</h3>
        <center><img src="MCOMElevator.gif" alt="MCOMElevator"
            width = "400"
            length = "341" /> </center>
        
        <p><strong>Find issues with Current Design:</strong></p>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Buttons are not visually pleasing.</li>
        <li>Buttons are scattered in places.</li>
        <li>The current design when showing floors is not clear it looks like the elevator is going up and down at the same time,also the all the numbers arnt clear as well.</li>
        <li>The background of the numbers is not clear on the feedback moving up anddown floors.</li>
        <li>Doesnt look Simple.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Explain why it is good/bad:</strong></p>
        
        <p>The Good:</p>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>The buttons give feedback with a glowing red circle.</li>    
        <li>The buttons also have braille.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Bad:</p>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>The braille isnt effective to far from buttons in my opinion.</li>
        <li>The design is not visually pleasing for example one column is B, 3, 6, 9, 12. In my opinion it should just be 1, 2 ,3 ,4 and start a new column.</li>
        <li>The feedback on the floors moving is bad the arrow looks like its going both up and down, and the numbers background on the display isnt totally clear you can see multiple of numbers behind the original number. It should be clearer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>To Get a B, you need to:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and orther more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong></p>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Button Floor Levels</li>
        <li>Open and Close Buttons</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Uncommon Uses:</strong></p>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Bells Button</li>
        <li>Call Button</li>
        <li>Fire Fighter Button (Emergency Button)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Common Sequence of Actions:</strong></p>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>Walk into elevator.</li>
        <li>Turn around and find designated floor option.</li>
        <li>Push the floor button, wait for doors to close.</li>
        <li>If doors dont close fast enough, click the door close button.</li>
        <li>Wait while elevator moves either up or down.</li>
        <li>When doors open back up, leave elevator.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?</strong></p>
        <p>By providing all available floor buttons on one interface panel, to give options to the user to help find where your current destination could be. </p>
        <P><strong>How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?</strong></P>
        <p>After button the user chooses is pressed, it glows bright red on the out circles of the button, and the above screen shows a confusing arrow and numbers changing.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Mistakes With The Current Design</strong></p>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Buttons are disorganized, and not visually pleasing.</li>
        <li>Red is not a color humans typically see best, green is more effective color in representing technology is working at the level the user desires.</li>
        <li>Green should be the color representation not red.</li>
        <li>The additional emergency buttons should be more togethor instead of spread apart like in the current design: this includes (Firefighter, Bell, and Call options).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Suggest Improvements to make on the control interface, sketch the solotion and then justify it.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>My Low Fidelity Prototype Sketch</h3>
        <center><img src="p1.Michael.Bolla.jpg" alt="p1.Michael.Bolla"
            width = "400"
            length = "341" /> </center>
       
        <p><strong>My Design Decisions:</strong></p>
        <p>My Design Decisions: I added a voice button allowing users to speak to the control panel for a designated floor option (this is
            and accessibility feature), I made the buttons more visibly pleasing and linear, of the main control panel from the left starts
            with floor one and underneath all the main numbers in the middle represents the basement for clarity. The open and close door buttons
            are closer together near the basement button underneath all the primary floor buttons. The bell and emergency buttons are not
            spread out allowing the user in a panicked situation to be able to click both at the same time and allow to call for emergency services. 
            Also on the physical buttons i provided the braille so users would not have to find the button after finding the correct location of the
            braille, the braille is actually on the button so once they find it they can just push!</p>

        <p><strong>Now Imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator. To get a A, you need to:</strong></p>
        <p>Come up with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size you want?</p>   
        <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>I am using my Low-Fidelity Prototype Sketch as the base design.</li>
        <li>The size will be roughly the size of a large iPad, 9.8 inches by 6.8 inches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Design and Implement Interactive Features</p>
        <p>Added all 18 buttons, provided an extra voice button that allows the users to speak to (whatever voice recognition system, siri in this case) to be able to tell the elevator what floor to go to.</p>
        <p><strong>Design and Implement User Feedback</strong></p>
        <p>Any button that gets pressed will highlight green to the user as it was pressed, giving the user feedback that their current choice has been recognized and the task is now in operation.</p>
        
        <h3>My Processing Design Based Off Of My Low Fidelity Sketch</h3>

            width = "400"
            length = "341" /> </center>
        <h3>GIF Version Of My Processing Design</h3>
        <center><img src="p1.Michael.Bolla.gif" alt="p1.Michael.Bolla"

    <p><strong>You Can get Extra Credits If:</strong></p>
    <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>Your design supports people with disabilities.</li>
    <li>You provide extra useful information on the display interface.</li>
    <li>Your Imagination...</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Extra Credit Anwsers</strong></p>
    <p>I was able to implement braille in a more effective area compared to the design at the TTU MCOM building to be fair this is suppose to be a touch screen,
        so I will argue this shows where to put the dot stickers on the ipad for people with disabilities. So in this case they will be able to find the button and just push. Every Single
        button on the processing control interface has braille. Where my imagination came into play was adding a voice activation button to the design. Since my specs were iPad based having
        a digital assistant like siri can be extremely useful for people with disabilities. Because instead you can either click the voice button and ask for a designated floor or just say,
        "Hey Siri, please take me to floor 10", where siri would respond saying "Taking you to floor 10". My imagination came into play by utilizing some resources we already currently
        have and implementing it in a solution where it could be extremely useful for people with disabilities. </p>
